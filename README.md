# Currently supported functionality

* You can add items on the list that you'd like to do
* You can make the list items active/completed or delete them


# Terms and conditions.
Now any terms or conditions. Please, feel free to use whatever you like here. :smile:
That was made for studying the logic of Redux and definitely needs a better look, I'll improve once.
It would be nice to notify 
me in case of deployment, I will be happy to help with it or to see that.
